# Avalanche Subnet
Avalanche Subnet is a simple illustration of the usefulness of the Avalanche EVM subnet to deploy and test contracts locally.

## Description
This simple illustration consist of two contracts that are deployed to an Avalache subnet setup locally. The subnet acts like an EVM that hosts our contracts and allow transactins (Quicker and less gas transactions). Imagine it as your own set up testnet network. You can create a token that will be used as native tokens for paying of gas fees.

https://docs.avax.network/tooling/cli-create-deploy-subnets/create-subnet is a link to the Avalanche official docs that shows how to set up and deploy your first local subnet. You can then deploy contracts to your subnet and test them. If you don't have the widely know testnet tokens, you can set up yours.
